This is an invoice managment basic app

## Running locally

Clone the repo and install the libraries

### `git clone git@github.com:gsalgadotoledo/invoice-app.git`
### `cd invoice-app`
### `npm install`

After installing dependencies start the mock server running...

### `npm run db`

It'll make the mock json server run in this url [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).<br />
It will use the terminal window to show thw json-server logs


Finally you're ready to run the frontend in a new terminal window

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

I didnt have time to create test I left a couple of really simple tests.<br />
